zstd - library files
================================

The __lib__ directory contains several files, but depending on target use case, some of them may not be necessary.

#### Minimal library files

To build the zstd library the following files are required:

- [common/bitstream.h](common/bitstream.h)
- [common/error_private.h](common/error_private.h)
- [common/error_public.h](common/error_public.h)
- common/fse.h
- common/fse_decompress.c
- common/fse_static.h
- common/huf.h
- common/huf_static.h
- [common/mem.h](common/mem.h)
- [common/zstd.h]
- common/zstd_internal.h
- common/zstd_static.h
- compress/fse_compress.c
- compress/huf_compress.c
- compress/zstd_compress.c
- compress/zstd_opt.h 
- decompress/huf_decompress.c
- decompress/zstd_decompress.c

Stable API is exposed in [common/zstd.h].
Advanced and experimental API is exposed in [common/zstd_static.h].
API elements of [common/zstd_static.h] should be used with static linking only,
as their definition may change in future version of the library.

[common/zstd.h]: common/zstd.h
[common/zstd_static.h]: common/zstd_static.h


#### Separate compressor and decompressor

To build a separate zstd compressor all files from `common/` and `compressor/` directories are required.
In a similar way to build a separate zstd decompressor all files from `common/` and `decompressor/` directories are needed.


#### Buffered streaming

This complementary API makes streaming integration easier.
It is used by `zstd` command line utility, and [7zip plugin](http://mcmilk.de/projects/7-Zip-ZStd) :

- common/zbuff.h
- common/zbuff_static.h
- compress/zbuff_compress.c
- decompress/zbuff_decompress.c

#### Dictionary builder

To create dictionaries from training sets :

- dictBuilder/divsufsort.c
- dictBuilder/divsufsort.h
- dictBuilder/zdict.c
- dictBuilder/zdict.h
- dictBuilder/zdict_static.h

#### Miscellaneous

The other files are not source code. There are :

 - LICENSE : contains the BSD license text
 - Makefile : script to compile or install zstd library (static or dynamic)
 - libzstd.pc.in : for pkg-config (make install)
